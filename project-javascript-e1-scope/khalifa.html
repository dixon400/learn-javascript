      /* The console prints blue when you log `color` because itis defined in a global scope
      which means it is not within a function hence overrides every other color.

      The logColor1 prints nothing because it represents a local scope and there is no 
      parameter or color defined within the scope 
      
      The logColor2 argument prints red because it has a parameter named color and 
      this has been defined within the local scope
      
      The logColor3 argument prints light green because  it has  a  variable declared as such 
      with a conditional statement hence if the contion is not met, nothing will be passed to the console */
